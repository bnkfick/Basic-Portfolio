Portfolio page links to nonexistent pages.  
Not sure if I should be floating the images for the project items left.  Since the container has a width, resizing doesn't cause the image blocks to restack.  Questions/Todo - how would I replace an hr with styles?  I have to work on that.
Just read more about using box-sizing: border-box and haven't looked at the way I've applied the width.  I think I didn't account for the border of my content-wrapper div.
Image link and text overlay are different links.  Is this the right way to do it? Since they could be different I'm not sure if there is a better way to do this.  
Also, is there a way to have the entire overlay rectangle a link and not just the text?  I will try to figure that out this weekend.
Looked for a way to add a list of enhancements to my git project.  I see how far  I get through the git videos this weekend.
